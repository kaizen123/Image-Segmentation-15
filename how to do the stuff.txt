TO REMEMBER
	do have a look at every threshold type's image database sent
	for every thresholding type, use only the image mentioned as 'original' given in that thresholding type's image database

- to read image
mention the path in imread command of read_image.m file

image = read_image();
(if image is in rgb format, also write image = rgb2gray(image) )

- to see histogram
imhist(image)

- to view image
figure,imshow(image)

1. global thresholding
[result, count] = global_method(image);
view result image
count saves the count after which loop converges in the code

2. global thresholding with smoothening
[result, im_filtered] = global_method_smooth(image);
view result image
im_filtered saves the smoothened image

3. global thresholding with sharpening
[result, gradient, imuseful, hist] = global_method_sharp(image);
view result image
gradient saves gradient of the image
imuseful saves the image and gradient product
hist saves the histogram of imuseful

4. otsu method thresholding
result = otsu_method(image);
view result image

5. adaptive thresholding
result = adaptive_method(image);
view result image
